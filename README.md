# A-Study-On-Analysing-Failure-Rates-Of-Storage-Devices-
Developed an HDD failure prediction model using WLLGM, improving accuracy over MLR and reducing false positives. Applied Python for preprocessing, normalization, and optimization using WOA for tuning and LS-SVM for enhancement. Provided insights to minimize HDD replacements, cutting costs and improving predictive maintenance.
